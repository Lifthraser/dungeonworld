    <p>When you <strong>put out word that you’re looking to hire help</strong>,
    roll. If you make it known...</p>

    <p>• ...that your pay is generous, take +1</p>

    <p>• ...what you’re setting out to do, take +1</p>

    <p>• ...that they’ll get a share of whatever you find, take +1</p>

    <p>If you have a useful reputation around these parts take an additional +1.
    On a 10+ you’ve got your pick of a number of skilled applicants, your choice
    who you hire, no penalty for not taking them along. On a 7–9 you’ll have to
    settle for someone close or turn them away. On a miss someone influential
    and ill-suited declares they’d like to come along (a foolhardy youth, a
    loose-cannon, or a veiled enemy, for example), bring them and take the
    consequences or turn them away. If you turn away applicants you take -1
    forward to Recruit.</p>
