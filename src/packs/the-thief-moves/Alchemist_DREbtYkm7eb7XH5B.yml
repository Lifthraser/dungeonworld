  description: >-
    <p>When<strong> you have time to gather materials and a safe place to brew
    </strong>you can create three doses of any poison you’ve used before.
    Alternately you can describe the effects of a poison you’d like to create.
    The GM will tell you that you can create it, but with one or more
    caveats:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>It will only work under specific circumstances.</li>

    <li>The best you can manage is a weaker version.</li>

    <li>It’ll take a while to take effect.</li>

    <li>It’ll have obvious side effects.</li>

    </ul>
