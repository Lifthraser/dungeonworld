  description: '<p>When you <strong>call upon the spirits to change your shape</strong>, roll+WIS.</p><p>You may take on the physical form of any species whose essence you have studied or who lives in your land: you and your possessions meld into a perfect copy of the species’ form. You have any innate abilities and weaknesses of the form: claws, wings, gills, breathing water instead of air. You still use your normal stats but some moves may be harder to trigger—a housecat will find it hard to do battle with an ogre. The GM will also tell you one or more moves associated with your new form. <strong>Spend 1 hold to make that move.</strong></p><p>Once you’re out of hold, you return to your natural form. At any time, you may spend all your hold and revert to your natural form.</p>'
