## Bug fixes

- Identified several locations where the system was still using <whatevs>.data._id rather than <whatevs>.id, per v9's API. Refactored the logic to account for those.
- Fixed drag and drop issue in the combat tracker.
- Fixed error "You must choose a valid class before you can level up."
- Fixed issue with chat cards not applying XP.
