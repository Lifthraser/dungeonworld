  description: >-
    <p>When you have time with a willing or helpless subject you can craft an
    ethereal&nbsp;tether with them. You perceive what they&nbsp;do and can
    discern realities about them or&nbsp;their surroundings, no matter the
    distance. Someone willingly tethered to you can communicate with you over
    the tether as if you were in the room with them.</p>
