    <p>When you <strong>allow your animal companion to take a blow that was
    meant for you</strong>, the damage is negated and your animal companion’s
    ferocity becomes 0. If its ferocity is already 0 you can’t use this ability.
    When you have a few hours of rest with your animal companion its ferocity
    returns to normal.</p>
