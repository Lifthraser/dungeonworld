## Compatible Foundry Versions
![Foundry v11.315](https://img.shields.io/badge/Foundry-v11.315-green)

## Changes

- Updated compendium build script to use the fvtt cli. This allows us to compile directly to LevelDB for Foundry v11, rather than the older NeDB setup that had to be converted when a world was loaded.
- We moved to Github! This shouldn't affect your games directly, but the code repository is now on Github rather than Gitlab. All issues have been migrated to the new repository, and the main reason for the migration was the increased quota of build minutes on Github allowing me to integrate more tests into our pull request and release processes.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed several bugs related to text editors and displaying their content as enriched. There's still some work left to do on this related to the level up dialog and compendium entries in journals, but character and item sheets should now all display links and rolls properly!
