    <p>When you <strong>consult your accumulated knowledge about
    something,</strong> roll+Int. On a 10+ the GM will tell you something
    interesting and useful about the subject relevant to your situation. On a
    7–9 the GM will only tell you something interesting—it’s on you to make it
    useful. The GM might ask you “How do you know this?” Tell them the truth,
    now.</p>
