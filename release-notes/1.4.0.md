## Features

Added improved support for Homebrew World thanks to @mangofeet! The following new system settings have been added:

- Setting to ignore default DW compendium data for purposes of auto-filling a character sheet at creation time.
- Setting to import other compendium data for custom classes. Custom compendium can be implemented via prefixes, such as `hbw-the-fighter-moves` for overwritten Fighter moves.
- Setting to use raw ability mods instead of scores/mods.
- Setting to remove stat increase on level up
- Settings to ignore adding constitution and str to health and max load respectively
- Setting overrides for stat debility labels

## Bugfixes

- Fix xpFormula check to handle bare numbers for static XP level up
- More item details on the character creation dialog
