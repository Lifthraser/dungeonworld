    <p>When you <strong>reach the end of a session</strong>, choose one your
    bonds that you feel is resolved (completely explored, no longer relevant, or
    otherwise). Ask the player of the character you have the bond with if they
    agree. If they do, mark XP and write a new bond with whomever you wish. Once
    bonds have been updated look at your alignment. If you fulfilled that
    alignment at least once this session, mark XP. Then answer these three
    questions as a group:</p>

    <p>• Did we learn something new and important about the world?</p>

    <p>• Did we overcome a notable monster or enemy?</p>

    <p>• Did we loot a memorable treasure?</p>

    <p>For each “yes” answer everyone marks XP.</p>
