    <p>When you<strong> satisfy an appetite to the
    </strong><strong>extreme</strong> (destroying something unique and
    significant, gaining enormous fame, riches, power, etc.) you may choose to
    resolve it. Cross it off the list and mark XP. While you may pursue that
    appetite again, you no longer feel the burning desire you once did. In its
    place, choose a new appetite from the list or write your own.</p>
