Manifest URL: https://gitlab.com/asacolips-projects/foundry-mods/dungeonworld/-/raw/1.5.0/system.json

## Features

- Added a new system setting to allow the debility feature on ability scores to trigger disadvantage on rolls instead of a penalty (thanks @friendlylambda!)
- Added the Swedish tranlsation for the system (thanks Krister!)

## Bugfixes

- Fixed an issue with custom XP formulas not working. This also resolves an issue where warnings would be triggered for async roll evaluation when adjusting XP on characters.
- Partially fixed an issue where duplicate moves would be assigned to new characters when they were created by players. There are still some edge cases where this can happen (e.g. two GM users are signed in simultaneously) but the more common cases should be resolved. The issue for this will be left open until it's fully resolved.
