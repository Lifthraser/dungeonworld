    <p>When you <strong>act despite an imminent threat or suffer a
    calamity</strong>, say how you deal with it and roll. If you do it...</p>

    <p>• by powering through, +Str</p>

    <p>• by getting out of the way or acting fast, +Dex</p>

    <p>• by enduring, +Con</p>

    <p>• with quick thinking, +Int</p>

    <p>• through mental fortitude, +Wis</p>

    <p>• sing charm and social grace, +Cha</p>

    <p>On a 10+, you do what you set out to, the threat doesn’t come to bear. On
    a 7–9, you stumble, hesitate, or flinch: the GM will offer you a worse
    outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.</p>
