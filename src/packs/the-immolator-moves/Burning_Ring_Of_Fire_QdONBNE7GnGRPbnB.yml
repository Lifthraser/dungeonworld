    <p>When you<strong> fuse a willing personâ€™s soul to yours</strong>,
    roll+CHA. On a hit you are bound together, able to sense each other at any
    distance, as well as sharing your emotional state. On a 7-9, the connection
    is unstable and dangerous, when you take a debility, so do they (and vice
    versa). On a miss, the branding is rejected and you both erase any Bonds you
    have to each other. You may write new Bonds with them at the End of Session
    as usual. This fusion, once performed, cannot be undone by mortal means.</p>
