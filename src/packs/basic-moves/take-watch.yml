    <p>When you’re <strong>on watch and something approaches the camp</strong>,
    roll+Wis. On a 10+ you’re able to wake the camp and prepare a response, the
    camp takes +1 forward. On a 7–9 you react just a moment too late; the camp
    is awake but hasn’t had time to prepare. You have weapons and armor but
    little else. On a miss whatever lurks outside the campfire’s light has the
    drop on you.</p>
