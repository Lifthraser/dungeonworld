    <p>When you go to <strong>buy something with money on hand</strong>, if it’s
    something readily available in the settlement you’re in, you can buy it at
    market price. If it’s something special, beyond what’s usually available
    here, or non-mundane, roll+Cha. On a 10+ you find what you’re looking for at
    a fair price. On a 7–9 you’ll have to pay more or settle for something
    similar.</p>
